# PSO-Based Adversarial Machine Learning Attack on NIDS Datasets

This project demonstrates the use of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to conduct Adversarial Machine Learning (AML) attacks on Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) datasets. The aim is to analyze the influence of black-box AML algorithms on NIDS performance.

## Project Overview

Adversarial Machine Learning (AML) explores vulnerabilities in machine learning models by generating adversarial samples designed to deceive classifiers. In this project, PSO is employed to optimize adversarial perturbations, thereby evaluating the resilience of NIDS against such attacks. Performance metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrices are used to assess the model's robustness.

## Requirements

The necessary libraries are listed and imported within the notebook. Typical dependencies include:

- Python (>= 3.x)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow/Keras (if deep learning models are used)

## Running the Notebook

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook environment.
2. Load the `Final.ipynb` file.
3. Run the notebook cell by cell to:
   - Preprocess the dataset.
   - Apply PSO to generate adversarial samples.
   - Evaluate the model performance through confusion matrices and accuracy metrics.

## Results

- The project evaluates the impact of PSO-based AML attacks on NIDS performance.
- Results are visualized using confusion matrices and accuracy scores.

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to the research community exploring AML and NIDS for providing inspiration and foundational methodologies.

## Notes

- Ensure that the dataset is correctly loaded before running the attack simulations.
- The project is intended for research and educational purposes only.
